# libft âœ…125/100
My first static library in C

Contain extra functions that I've implemented later in my cursus

- ![LIBFT subject](fr.libft.subject.pdf)

To get the static library, you must do these commands :
```shell
cd libft
make
```

You also have theses commands for cleaning the libft directory :
```shell
# Clean all object files (*.o)
make clean

# Clean static library & object files
make fclean
```
